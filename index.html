      There's no way that's right! It has to be the north fork.

      Okay, okay, let's send scouting parties, we really can't afford to be wrong.
      That would be bad, it could extend our voyage for months.

    Grizzly bears are really really scary. One almost got me the other day! I thought they were
    only a danger to Indians with only bows.

    I'm new here and I know languages. Lots of them. I know the area and the Indians like me. Canada is great and all, but adventure is better.

    The river is starting to freeze. Time to settle down for the winter, a fort is in progress.

    First encounter with the Sioux. They seem nice enough, but they warn us of the dangers upstream. Time to put our charms on! <span class="htag">#smile</span>
